# System Overview

context is a **protocol repository** that defines collaboration rules for AI-assisted coding.

It is not an application or library. It provides:
- Constraints for AI behavior
- Decision-writing protocol
- Templates for project-local context

This repo is both the protocol definition AND a project that follows its own protocol.
