# Collaboration Rules

## Core rules

- Always read this repository before coding.
- Do not rely on model-internal memory.
- All shared understanding must exist as files.
- Decisions override comments and discussions.
- When unsure, write a decision.

## Decision handling

- Open decisions are unprocessed messages from other agents.
- You must read, understand, and act before resolving.
- Never resolve without reading the full content.
