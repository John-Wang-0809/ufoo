# resources

Optional resources for AI-assisted coding workflows.

This repository intentionally contains non-core materials such as:
- `UI/` tone + anti-pattern references
- `ICONS/` reference icon subsets (with licenses)

It is designed to be installed and managed by `ufoo` under `~/.ufoo/modules/resources`.
